objective: This site redesign was completed in part of a larger brand awareness campaign for COM 353 at Purdue University to assist Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Lafayette. The intentions of this redesign focused on recruiting more Big volunteers for the organization through bold fonts, colors, and strong language. A large portion of the redesign centered around new navigation and language development to emphasize the importance of a Big/Little pairing for BBBS.
role1: Designer
role2: Team Lead

results: In comparison to the current site design, the results of this redesign align with the larger organizationâ€™s branding. The design was completed over a two-week period, but with the organization having limited resources, development will be put off until a later semester.
