year: 2020
type: Web
objective: This site is designed to attract media attention to Purdue Agriculture experts. I was tasked to develop the site as a web intern for Purdue Agriculture. To carry out this site redesign, changes were made to align with new branding changed throughout Purdue University. The core components of the development were to create an easy-to-edit site that focuses on search engine keywords.
role1: Developer
results: This site is still an ongoing process to research keywords and update. However, the development was completed in a three-month period utilizing WordPress, Beaver Builder, and Advanced Custom Fields.
