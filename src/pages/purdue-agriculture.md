title: Purdue Agriculture Media Outreach
featuredImage: ../images/mockups/purdue_agriculture_mockup.jpg
year: 2020
type: Web
objective: This site was designed to attract media attention to Purdue Agriculture experts for interviews and insight into trending topics. I was tasked to develop the site as a web intern for Purdue Agriculture. To carry out this site redesign, changes were made to align with new branding changed throughout Purdue University that occurred a few weeks prior. The core components of the development were to create an easy-to-edit site that focuses on search engine keywords.
role1: Developer
role2: SEO Researcher
role3: Troubleshooter
approach: This site was built in WordPress with the Beaver Builder plugin and Advanced Custom Fields. We developed the site to be editable so the writers that would be managing the site could easily change a portion and the rest of the page will update.
results: This site was designed and developed throughout a two-month period but is being continually updated by Purdue Agriculture. After recreating this site, Purdue Agriculture saw more intentional writing practices and greater traffic to the site with increased SEO practices.
