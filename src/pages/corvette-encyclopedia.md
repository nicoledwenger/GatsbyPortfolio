objective: The purpose of this site was to create a more appealing, stripped down version of a wiki site. This site was developed as a course project for CGT 353 at Purdue University. As a budding car enthusiast, I was inspired to create a site that finds a balance between design and technical information without being too overwhelming.

results: This project was completed in a month utilizing HTML, CSS, and jQuery. This site met all evaluation criteria in fields relating to 508 compliancy, aesthetics, and development. The next steps in this site would be to expand its current application and simplify the site by turning it into a React application.
