featuredImage: ../images/calaveras.png
year: 2019
objective: This site was developed for a group project in CGT 353 at Purdue University. The goal of this site was to create a customized, appealing layout and design for a California state park. As state and national parks in the Unites States have a simplistic, consistent appearance across all parks, we wanted to create a more specialized experience to attract visitors.
role1: Designer
role2: Developer
role3: Team Lead
results: This project was completed from conception to development in a month using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The site met all requirements for the project in which it was being evaluated on 508 compliancy, aesthetics, and development.
