year: 2019
type: Branding
objective: This branding guide was created for ENGL 419 at Purdue University to benefit an upcoming art gallery for YWCA of Greater Lafayette. The art gallery was to display artwork created by members of YWCA to tell the experiences theyâ€™ve encountered. The branding guide was created to lead the rest of the class in their final deliverables; therefore, the language and feeling of the gallery was to be strong, yet sensitive.
role1: Branding
role2: Designer
results: This branding guide was created prior to any artwork; therefore, it was difficult to gauge the color and feeling behind the majority of the artwork. Regardless, the feedback and excitement from YWCA were very positive.
