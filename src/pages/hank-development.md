objective: This site was created for my senior capstone class to advertise the services of the development company myself and three other women started. The goal of this site was to enhance our credibility for clients, demonstrate our services, and show our expertise. We wanted to create a site that is simple and demonstrates our values as women in development. We also wanted to depict our diverse interests in terms of the projects and services we can offer.
role1: Developer
role2: Designer
role3: Owner
results: I developed this site using Gatsby.JS in a week and launched the site by hosting it through Github Pages. Currently, this site continues to be updated as we see fit throughout this year.
