year: 2020
objective: To take a break from digital projects, I enjoy going outdoors and exploring. I have the most experience in landscape photography but have done portrait photography and photojournalism. Taking the time to take photographs develops my skills in composition and editing in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.
role1: Photographer
role2: Editor
results: Many of these photographs were taken for personal projects and exploration, but I have experience in photojournalism and sports photography.
